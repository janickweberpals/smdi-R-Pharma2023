## Disclosures

::: callout-warning
## Disclosures

-   Janick Weberpals reports prior employment by Hoffmann-La Roche and previously held shares in Hoffmann-La Roche
-   This project was supported by Task Order 75F40119F19002 under Master Agreement 75F40119D10037 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
:::

## Background

Administrative insurance claims databases are increasingly linked to **electronic health records (EHR)** to improve confounding adjustment for variables which cannot be measured in administrative claims

::: callout-note
# Examples:

-   Labs (HbA1c, LDL, etc.)
-   Vitals (Blood pressure, BMI, etc.)
-   Disease-specific data (cancer stage, biomarkers, etc.)
-   Physician assessments (ECOG, etc.)
-   Lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol, etc.)

These covariates are often just partially observed for various reasons:

-   Physician did not perform/order a certain test
-   Certain measurements are just collected for particularly sick patients
-   Information is 'hiding' in unstructured records, e.g. clinical notes
:::

## Knowledge gaps and objectives

Missing data in EHR confounding factors are frequent

::: callout-note
# Two common missing data taxonomies

-   **Mechanisms**: Missing completely at random (MCAR), at random (MAR) and not at random (MNAR)
-   **Patterns**: Monotone, Non-monotone
:::

Unresolved challenges for `causal inference`:

-   In an empirical study, it is usually unclear which of the missing data patterns and mechanisms are dominating.
-   What covariate relationships exist and are partially observed covariates recoverable **in high-dimensional covariate spaces (e.g., database linkages)**?

## Objectives

::: callout-tip
# Objectives of the Sentinel Innovation Center Causal Inference Workstream

-   Develop a framework and tools to assess the structure of missing data processes in EHR studies
-   Connect this with the most appropriate analytical approach, followed by sensitivity analyses
-   **Develop an `R package` to implement framework and missing data investigations on a routine basis**\

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The whole game** - `smdi` workflow to perform routine missing data diagnostics

![Suggested `smdi` workflow.](images/workflow.jpg){fig-align="center"}


## `smdi` bundled datasets

-   The `smdi` package comes with two exemplary **simulated** datasets:
    -   `smdi_data` (includes some partially observed covariates)
    -   `smdi_data_complete` (complete dataset if you prefer to introduce `NA` yourself)

```{r}
smdi_data |> 
  glimpse()
```

## Descriptives

-   Let's start with some light descriptives
-   All `smdi` functions automatically include all variables with at least one missing value (default)
-   Investigator-specified variables can be selected via the `covar` parameter

```{r}
smdi_data |> 
  smdi_summarize()
```

<!-- ## Descriptives - visual -->

<!-- Overall -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- smdi_data |>  -->
<!--   smdi_vis() -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Descriptives - visual -->

<!-- Stratified by another variable (stratum-specific sample size is the denominator) -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- smdi_data |>  -->
<!--   smdi_vis(strata = "exposure") -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Descriptives - pattern

`smdi` uses a *re-export* of the **naniar**[@naniar] `gg_miss_upset` and **mice**[@mice] `md.pattern` functions to investigate potentially underlying **missing data patterns**

::: callout-note
*Monotone and non-monotone (or general)*. A missing data pattern is said to be *monotone* if the variables $Y_j$ can be ordered such that if $Y_j$ is missing then all variables $Y_k$ with $k>j$ are also missing. This occurs, for example, in longitudinal studies with drop-out. If the pattern is not monotone, it is called *non-monotone* or *general*.[@mice]
:::

## Descriptives - pattern

`smdi` uses a *re-export* of the **naniar**[@naniar] `gg_miss_upset` function to investigate potentially underlying **missing data patterns**

```{r}
smdi_data |>  
  gg_miss_upset()
```

## `smdi_asmd`

> Group 1 diagnostics: Differences in covariate distributions

```{r}
asmd <- smdi_asmd(data = smdi_data, median = TRUE, includeNA = FALSE)
asmd
```

## `smdi_asmd`

> Group 1 diagnostics: Differences in covariate distributions

```{r}
asmd <- smdi_asmd(data = smdi_data, median = TRUE, includeNA = FALSE)
asmd
```

The output returns an *asmd* object with much more information than what is captured in the S3 generic *print* output, e.g. a complete '*Table 1*' that displays the covariate distributions of patients:

```{r}
head(asmd$pdl1_num$asmd_table1)
```

## `smdi_asmd`

> Group 1 diagnostics: Differences in covariate distributions

Investigators can also inspect standardized mean differences[@Austin2019] by covariate in detail:

```{r}
asmd$pdl1_num$asmd_plot
```

## `smdi_hotelling`

> Group 1 diagnostics: Differences in covariate distributions

Hotelling's[@hotelling1931] multivariate t-test examines differences in covariate distributions conditional on having an observed covariate value or not. Rejection of $H0$ would indicate significant differences between these patient strata.

```{r}
smdi_hotelling(data = smdi_data)
```

## `smdi_little`

> Group 1 diagnostics: Differences in covariate distributions

Little's[@little1988] chi-square test takes into account possible patterns of missingness **across all variables** in the dataset. A high test statistics and low p-value (rejection of $H0$) would indicate that the **global** missing data generating mechanism is not completely at random.

```{r}
smdi_little(data = smdi_data)
```

## `smdi_rf`

> Group 2 diagnostics: Ability to predict missingness

The `smdi_rf` function trains and fits a random forest model to assess the ability to predict missingness for the specified covariate(s).[@sondhi]

```{r}
auc <- smdi_rf(data = smdi_data, train_test_ratio = c(.7, .3), set_seed = 42, n_cores = 3)
auc
```

::: callout-tip
## Parallelization

Depending on the amount of data (sample size x covariates), the computation of the function can take some minutes. To speed this up, investigators can parallelize the computation using `n_cores` (UNIX only).
:::

## `smdi_rf`

The resulting `smdi_rf` object provides the flexibility to investigate the covariate importance of predictors which can give important hints on the potentially underlying missing data generating mechanism.

```{r}
auc$ecog_cat$rf_plot
```

## `smdi_outcome`

Group 3 diagnostic focuses on assessing the association between the missing indicator of the partially observed covariate and the outcome under study (is the missingness differential?).

```{r}
outcome <- smdi_outcome(
  data = smdi_data,  
  model = "cox",
  form_lhs = "Surv(eventtime, status)",
  exponentiated = FALSE
  )

outcome
```

::: callout-warning
## Supported regression types

Currently, the main types of outcome regressions are supported, namely *logistic (`glm`)*, *linear (`lm`)* and *Cox proportional hazards (`survival`)* models are supported and need to be specified using the model and form_lhs.
:::

## `smdi_diagnose`

::: callout-tip
## One function to rule them all: `smdi_diagnose`

-   Wrapper around all of the aforementioned functions
-   Input parameters correspond to parameters of the individual functions
:::

Let's take a look at a most minimal example

```{r}
diagnostics <- smdi_diagnose(
  data = smdi_data,
  model = "cox",
  form_lhs = "Surv(eventtime, status)",
  n_cores = 3
  )

diagnostics
```

## `smdi_diagnose`

Output is a list that resembles all three group diagnostics validated in the plasmode simulation study...

Covariate-specific table:

```{r}
diagnostics$smdi_tbl
```

Global Little's test p-value:

```{r}
diagnostics$p_little
```

## `smdi_style_gt`

`smdi_style_gt` takes an object of class *smdi* (i.e., the output of `smdi_diagnose`) and formats it into a **publication-ready** `gt` table:

```{r}
diagnostics |> 
  smdi_style_gt(font_size = 18, tbl_width = 1000)
```

## `smdi_style_gt`

Since `smdi_style_gt` transforms the *smdi* object into an object of class *gt_tbl*, an investigator can also take advantage of all of the `gt` package perks, e.g. exporting the table in different formats, e.g. .docx, .rtf, .pdf, etc.:

```{r}
#| eval: false
gtsave(
  data = smdi_style_gt(diagnostics),
  filename = "smdi_table.docx", # name of the final file and file type (e.g., .docx)
  path = "." # path where the file should be stored
  )
```

## Test it out yourself

```{r}
#| eval: false

# CRAN (current version: 0.2.2)
install.packages("smdi")

# dev version
devtools::install_git("https://gitlab-scm.partners.org/janickweberpals/smdi.git")
